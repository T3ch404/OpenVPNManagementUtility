# OpenVPNManagementUtility
This project is built around two scripts that were based on the Digital Ocean guide to build an OpenVPN server on Ubuntu 20.04. They provide a simpler interface for creating and revoking .ovpn configuration files.

<h2>Usage</h2>
These scripts must be run with sudo from the ~/Easy-rsa directory that was created while building the OpenVPN server. It doesn't matter which script is run first as it will walk you through each step of the selected process.
